# NetPHp Sample

This is a usage sample project for the [NetPhp](https://github.com/david-garcia-garcia/netphp) library.

To setup the sample project:

1. Clone the project from Github or download.
2. Open the netphp-sample.sln file with Visual Studio or any PHP IDE of your choice.

For this sample to work you must have the NetPhp binaries deployed.

In these examples you will see how to consume the .Net runtime binaries directly from PHP
using the COM_DOTNET and the NetPhp binary as a bridge, with an autogenerated PHP class model.

```php

// Make sure the Runtime is Initialized.
RuntimeManager::Instance()->InitializeRuntime();

$today = \ms2\System\netDateTime::Today();
$day_of_week = $today->DayOfWeek()->ToString()->Val();
$month = $today->Month()->Val();

echo "<br>Today is: $day_of_week</br>";
echo "<br>Month: $month</br>";

// Open a directory with process explorer
\ms2\System\Diagnostics\netProcess::_Start("explorer.exe", "c:\\");

```
